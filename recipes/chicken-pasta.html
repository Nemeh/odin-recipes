        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'cent®) (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix cider vinegar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes, monosodium glutamate, black pepper, and salt in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken pieces into marinade, seal bag, and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove chicken from marinade; discard used marinade. Cook chicken in hot oil until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Stir frequently. Transfer chicken to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving accumulated juices in skillet.</li>
            <li>Whisk whipping cream into pan juices and cook until cream has started to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken back into skillet and reduce heat to low. Simmer chicken in cream sauce until sauce is thick, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Gently stir cooked noodles into skillet with chicken and cream sauce.</li>
